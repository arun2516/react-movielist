The film follows the story of Das and his team planning to kidnap the only son of a politician. Later, they come to know that the politician's son has been planning his own kidnap to loot his father's money. When a mad cop is brought in to investigate, the film takes a turn."},

The film is about a skilled con man who uses the weakness of people to pull off high-profile scams. It gets interesting when the people whom he cheated plan to teach him a lesson."},
  {name:"Ready or Not",pic:"https://img1.hotstarext.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_hcdl/sources/r1/cms/prod/3255/663255-h",summary:"Ready or Not is the perfect movie to kick off this list. This story of a young woman (Samara Weaving) marrying into a rich, legacy family takes a stunning twist early and never looks back. And if you don't know where the story goes, well, we don't want to be the ones to tell you‚Äîbut things get bloody and violent and we really scrape at human depravity. The movie sits somewhere in between horror and thriller, but throughout it remains a sharp, biting satire of class differences, and keeps audiences laughing through every twisted and dark turn."},

Burn After Reading is similar to Fargo in the fact that its telling a small-time, screwball crime-adjacent story; this one also ties in a thread about inept government agency screw-ups. Featuring Frances McDormand, George Clooney, John Malkovich, and one of the most entertaining Brad Pitt performances of all time."},

Told through a series of non-linear but connecting vignettes, the movie is a thrilling crime story that will have your jaw dropped one moment and find you laughing at a funny retort or something so outrageously absurd the next. One of the great movies of all time for balancing just about anyone could want in a movie in one package."},

He is out on parole and has to appear before the cops before 6 pm. As he decides to spend the time with his gang, he gets into trouble with a barber named Pichai (Ram). Managa decided to kill Pichai and things go beyond control."},
